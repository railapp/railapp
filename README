== What does it include?

- Many typical models: users, roles, cities, countries, invoices, goals, etc.
- Userstamp plug-in which extends ActiveRecord to add automatic updating of 'creator' and 'updater' attributes.
- A new app/presenter directory for presenters that work with your controllers and views-- see Martin Fowler's Presentation Model
- Seed data for countries and provinces


== Database

Many typical ruby on rails applications are read often, write rarely. To help this, we index many database fields to increase read speed and efficiency:

- fields for joins, such as foreign keys
- fields for sorting, such as dates and times
- fields for calculations, such as latitude and longitude
- fields for autocompletions, such as user names and keywords


== ISO Standards

Countries use the ISO 3166-2 international standard. For example the United States is "US" and Cananda is "CA". Country subdivisions such as states, provinces, and territories all use ISO 3166 codes. For example, California is "US-CA" and Ontario is "CA-ON".


== Seed Data

Seed data is in /lib/tasks/db_seed_*.rake To seed, run these rake tasks:

- rake db:seed:countries
- rake db:seed:provinces
