* Here are some of the default carrier values:
		
    Alltel Wireless   =>  "alltel"
    AT&T/Cingular     =>  "at&t"
    Boost Mobile      =>  "boost"
    Sprint Wireless   =>  "sprint"

  carriers as well.</b>

* If you want to set a custom from e-mail per SMS message, you can do so 
  by doing the following.

    deliver_sms("5558675309","at&t","message", :from => "bob@test.com")

* You can set the maximum length of the SMS message, which is not set by
  default.  Most phones can only accept 128 characters.  To do this just 
  specify the limit option.

    deliver_sms("5558675309","at&t","message", :limit => 128)

* You can retrieve just the formatted address to use in your own mailer.

    get_sms_address("5558675309","at&t") # => "5558675309@txt.att.net"
